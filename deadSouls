No one was suggesting that the dead were still alive, or that the dead—by virtue of their having once been alive—did not vanish and cease to exercise an influence over the world; or that the dead’s having lived somehow exempted them from a tax status that was in the strictest sense exclusive. For was it not absurd to call “dead” that which continued to color the thinking and pronouncements of agreeable gentlemen everywhere? No, these were apes and imposters of the dead, still subject to annihilation, with names that could be written down and compiled into lists. Even supposing the names of the dead were allowed, by some accident of bookkeeping, to persist beyond the death of their referents, merely by their having persisted on certain municipal tax rolls, for instance, this did not imply that the referent persisted, or that any connection between referent and name persisted, by which means the living could “remember” the annihilated soul, invoke their memory at political meetings, and such. For it was plain to see that 
But Chichikov knew that the dead could not be killed again. You could not exhume the dead and induce a second death upon their already dead cadavers.
and that, by that byzantine logic, the dead had  had not never existed at any point in time
He knew, on the one hand, that the dead, merely by their being dead, did not vanish altogether.  The dead left a mark—the little divot of air marking their having once been alive—and that this was very different from people who didn’t exist.
For, certainly, while it was one of the axioms of history that, in order to have died, one must have first been alive for a time, this “having been alive for a time” did not confer upon the dead the properties that are, quite demonstrably, within the purview of those who were still living (and who, by that property, had not yet been annihilated)—the shifting of eyebrows in affected poise, for instance, or the moving of one’s limbs without the aid of an accomplice, or the holding forth amicably on topics of interest to agreeable gentlemen everywhere, or …active measures in the memories and pre-cognitive spaces of an all-too-impressionable public life, and so forth.

Now the coals
Now the coals had died down, and the pipe smoke rose and took unknown shapes in the darkness above their heads. For a long time now, the mantlepiece clock above the fireplace had been lost in the upturned shadow of the mantle, and Manilov could not tell the hour.  Even so, it had been possible to keep a time of sorts by marking its passage in terms of silent intervals between agreeable commentaries and clever turns of phrase. These silences had gradually dilated,    Manilov made as though to speak and mark the end of another measure of silence, but instead descended into a fit of coughing. Only the dancing pools of shadow were visible on his guest’s face, and not his guest’s face. The eyes of the two gentlemen deepened into little pools of shadow that flickered and steadied by turns, like murder weapons resting at the bottom of remote forest ponds; and Manilov pinched his lapels between thumb and forefinger in a fresh affectation at speech, instead descended into a fit of coughing. Each successive utterance was a mannerly shell of, and difficult to tell apart from, the utterance that preceded it, but had no connection to the previous commentaries, nor to anything else in the world, as regards logic and meaning.
Manilov was able to mark the evening’s passage by the intervals of silence punctuated by amicable utterances.  The successive utterance had little connection to the previous as regards meaning.

And instead of the words he had formed his mouth to utter, he choked on a bit of his saliva and descended into a fit of coughing, whence he nearly did not extract himself.  Only the dancing pools of shadow were visible on his guest’s face, and not his guest’s face.

WE RECOGNIZE on the earth the rolling contours of country fields, the windscorched green and brown tufts of wheat and heather, and their borders of still denser copse, born more of the idea of property than of the earth itself.  Between the masses of landed property run the thin cataracts of road owned by the municipal state, and carved across the particular fields are the foot- and cart-worn paths of the serfs.  At the highest points of the land are perched the manors and mansions of the aristocracy.  Besides these principal aspects, there are here and there aberrant groupings of trees, occasionally quite dense and substantial enough, we sense, to be distant factors; there is, as well, the endless complexity of the “ecosystem,” the relations and domains of flora and fauna thereto pertaining, which extend to microscopic levels and do not come into the range of categories which our broad perspective affords; and, conversely, there are the numerous absences and silences of little note: no birds singing, no leaves on the trees, no scenes of animals, no centers of social commotion.  The peasantry are out of sight, but only for the moment; their little roofs stay hidden beneath the horizon.  All around the periphery are the correct and phased array of symbols, and also from time to time the things which are not, in the end, actually there.  
Above, clouds pass by in phased disarray, like scattered ranks of some vanquished army, and are the only suggestion to the eyes that time has not stopped [connects with: “but it was easier to stop time”]. Behind this, the pale tablet of sky forced itself onto the literary space again and again in an unwanted tryst, piercing the eyes of any who happen to gaze upon it with a splitting pain in the forehead. Maybe just one patch of blue sky behind the right shoulder of Christ Pantocrator who offers an enigmatic greeting from the cathedral zenith, framed by spiraling babies and saints, raising his right hand in enigmatic mudra with his fingers. “Is He  flipping us off?” marvels the passing traveler. But no, Christ is not flipping us off.  The aural space, meanwhile, is occupied almost exclusively by the staccato gusts and blusters of the wind which all year does not cease accosting the face of land and people, and even seems to aspire to the totality of silence itself. And in those instances when the wind stops, one is overwhelmed by the silence which is even harder to hear; and to which one cannot close one’s ears.
These were some of the general elements describing, in broad strokes, the ambient sphere of rising action.  Now it happened that there fared, on one of the municipal roads, a light spring britzka which cut deep furrows into the road, as though bearing a heavy cargo.  But inside this britzka there was only our hero, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, who reviewed certain notes of his in advance of the interview he would soon have with Monsieur H—k, a certain nobleman of those parts, whom he had met at the recent governor’s soirée.
Now the mansion appeared atop a knob in the distance, like a fly which suddenly alights atop a heap of shit, and the proprietor of the estate, I believe I already mentioned his name—a certain Monsieur H—k, whom Chichikov had met at the recent governor’s soirée—issued from the door in his pajamas to greet our hero, his pate bared and his carrick thrown devil-may-care over his frock and jacket—clearly, he was impatient to understand something.  He approached Chichikov, who had himself scarcely stepped off of his sideboards, at an urgent pace, but held up at three meters or so, and did not extend his hand in greeting.
“Oh, have you forgotten something?” he asked.
“But I have just gotten here!” replied Chichikov.
“Just gotten where?”
“Here!  Where else?”
“But...”
And the two men let a silence pass between them, each one scouring the other’s countenance for the secret meaning that was at play.  At last, M. H—k broke into laughter.
“Ha!  Such a joker you are, Monsieur Chichikov, dear me!  You really know how to hang noodles from our ears.  And with that revizor face of yours, who would ever know!  Ha ha!”
But Chichikov was not laughing.  “But I’m serious,” he assured him, “I just arrived at your estate now.”
“Ha ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Yes indeed!  I know you’ve just arrived, indeed!  Ha!”
“No but, I’m terribly sorry dear host, it’s not a joke.  You see.  I tell you in all earnestness, with all the sincerity of my being, I have just arrived at your estate.”
“Just arrived?  But…then…are you sure?”
“I’m terribly sorry, but yes sir.”
“But, well then, I suppose it’s possible.”
“I should say so…”
“But, well, then please excuse me.  How embarrassing, if I had known, I would have dressed.  It’s just, the resemblance is striking.  Yes, well, please come in.  And what is your name, good sir?”
“I am Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov.”
	At this the host lay himself gently on the ground and clutched his stomach tightly, kicking at the small stones and rubble of his driveway.  “Haaaa ha!  Haaaaaaaaa ha!  Yes, it was you all along!  Ha!  Ha!  Ho!  Yes, oh dear, I was not wrong!  Ho ho!”
	“But, forgive me, dear Monsieur, I haven’t the faintest clue about what you are implying.”
	“Not the faintest clue!  Haaaaa!—”
	“Please, Monsieur—”
	“Ha ha ha ha!  Ha!”
	“An odd fellow,” Chichikov murmured to himself, and turned to take his departure.  But just as he mounted his britzka, the laughter all at once ceased, and he heard H—k raising himself from the ground; and indeed, turning around again, he saw his host upright, staring quite seriously at the road below.
	“But that is your britzka there,” he pointed, “driving along the road to N.”
	Chichikov looked and saw that it was true.  A light spring britzka, which was not at all unlike his own—indeed, which was exactly like his own, and no different—plied its way down the road to N.
“You see,” said the host, “I thought you were him there, come back for something you’d forgotten.  But now I see that he is quite clearly on his way into town, and has not returned…I mean to say, clearly it is evident now that you are not him, there in that britzka, but an altogether different Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, here.  Though you are identical in every respect, though you have the same name, the same britzka, the same physiognomy, all this must be pure coincidence…”
“I’m sorry!” declaimed Chichikov indignantly, and took one step backward toward his britzka, then another, quickly, as if the sudden masque of identity was simply too much and he must flee immediately.  But he vacillated, and when the decisive moment had passed he said again, “I’m sorry,” but in a tone resigned to his presence at M. Sobakevich’s estate, “I am not that man.  If his name is also Chichikov, so be it; I am innocent of it.  I have no associations whatsoever with him, whatever the outward parity…”
Monsieur H—k looked up through the little storm of data into Chichikov’s eyes, which surged presently with a tender suffering.  And with these words, our hero closed the remaining three meters and took H—k’s elbow in hand; and H—k offered no resistance, and was led up the front steps and through the door of his mansion.
The chestnut mare named Assessor, meanwhile—who remained harnessed to the britzka all this time—held them in her gaze for the whole time it took them to ascend the steps and enter the house—and then shook her head and let out a snort, as animals do when they have witnessed strange scenes.

Upon entering the house, Chichikov noticed nothing out of the ordinary by provincial standards.  The entry hall, vestibule and parlor were mostly empty and vacant, although bearing the clear scars of numerous attempts to fill it with life of some sort: a wall covered with portraits and scenes of all sizes which were completely covered over with soot, and which bore various inscriptions at their bases, such as “Zukhov” or “Conference at the Crossing”—but what the conference was all about remained a mystery; everything had to be guessed from a pair of hound legs sticking out at the bottom left corner.  Or, alternately, in the frame next to the “Crossing” stood a greaved pair of slim human legs, beneath which was inscribed in flourishing script something like: “Alexander the Great.”  A number of chairs and tea tables grazed about the center of the carpet, meanwhile, and had even worn through the floral pattern in some places, leaving behind threadbare patches through which the wood floor could be glimpsed.

ALL AROUND lay a sea of golden gray, which even crested and broke against the little berm of road which the light spring britzka traversed.  At the top of a knoll in the distance, a hound turned placidly about a spot on the ground and lay down.  Behind that, a solitary house rose up into view with bean rows planted in its front yard.  Then, further on, there were some goats being driven over the crest of a hill, with little twitching ears and noses.  Then there were some small houses which emerged from behind the forest and came gradually into view.  Indeed, the little houses themselves resembled a small herd of goats which had just been driven over the hillside and then frozen there by the spell of some Greek god, with little beetling ears and noses that resembled windows and stovepipes.  A settlement of houses came up on the right, presently, with one of the barn doors opened onto a threshing floor, where a pair of women were busy with the harvested sheaves.  Chichikov glimpsed their rosy arms flashing in the low auburn light before they snapped out of view.  Then: In front of one of the houses a mother reached down and scooped up a small child into her arms, heaving her up into the air.  Even at this distance the black hair of the two figures stood out from the black doorway that framed their sudden apparition.  But already the whole scene began to wink at Chichikov through the tall golden-grey grass as his britzka descended into another vale, and was gone.
You looked and looked again.  But what was it?  What was this strange sort of something-or-other that was there.  We listen in for the answer, but no answer comes forth.  “Well I,” pipes up someone sitting on the sofa of the parlor, and immediately remembers they are drunk and falls silent.  But such was Rus!  A laugh and a glimmer in the eyes—and like a racing troika it is gone!  One looks again, but there is nothing.  Only laughter and swirling snow give any evidence that there had been something there—whatever it was—and then the laughter and swirling snow also dissolve and vanish into nothingness.




Clinical Preface

Here presented for the first time is the so-called “Dead Souls” manuscript, authored by General Mikhail Tukhachevsky sometime between 1923 and 1931, while he was an intern at the Volokhskaya mental asylum, along the Volga River, near St. Petersburg, Russia.
The manuscript is presented in this easily accessible, “Everyman’s Edition,” without extensive notes or commentary, because it holds something for everyone, from military behavioralists to industrial gematryists.  The commentary and annotated editions are sure to be forthcoming, as this little book will generate much discussion.
Since I am named in the manuscript as one of its primary “characters,” and since my N.E.W. work of the period, here at Arlington, is now common (and declassified) knowledge, I have been asked to write this short preface introducing Level 5 to this remarkable document.
The manuscript here presented was apparently stored away in a ward filing cabinet in the corner of the psychiatrist’s office at Volokhskaya, where it lay preserved and forgotten for over eight decades.  In 1997, during the facility’s conversion to a tourist resort, the file cabinet was moved to the cellar, but the document remained undiscovered. It is only thanks to the recent re-emergence of Soviet Communism and the careful re-expropriation of the Volokhskaya estate that the Dead Souls manuscript ever came to light at all.
From the psychiatric standpoint, however, we have here nothing less than the first concrete example of a phased-compound prismotic event. From the other records that we have been able to retrieve from Volokhskaya, it is clear that Tukhachevsky entered the asylum diagnosed with acute compound schizophrenia (the patient projects a false personality which in turn projects another false personality).  The records also note a major deterioration in Tukhachevsky’s condition during his sophomore year—coinciding with the introduction of certain journal-keeping therapies prescribed by his doctor—but the diagnosis was not modified at any point during Tukhachevsky’s nine years at Volokhskaya.  It is my opinion that in this second year after being committed, Tukhachevsky’s condition deteriorated to what is now called a phased transpersonal event-schizophrenia, or a phased-event compound schizophrenic prismosis, of which the Dead Souls manuscript that follows is the mimetic focal of the phased-compound event cycle.
I make this claim because I treated the patient who was the inverse pole of the transpersonal (and trans-temporal) Tukhachevsky event cycle.  My patient, whose name remains classified, was also a war veteran (of a postmodern American war), and also thought he was Chichikov from Gogol’s novel Dead Souls.  And when he entered the “convalescent” phase of the compound cycle, his secondary projections were the converse of Tukhachevsky’s.  That is to say, whereas Tukhachevsky thought he was returning to sanity as my patient, my patient thought he was returning to sanity as General Tukhachevsy, and he projected the intimate elements of General Tukhachevsky’s life in the same detail that General Tukhachevsky projects certain details of my patient’s life in the manuscript below.  I can only say it is a shame the manuscript did not come to light earlier—it would have been very helpful in understanding the perplexing motives of my own patient, and in avoiding the unfortunate measures we ultimately were forced to take with him.
What about my “role” in the manuscript?  I can affirm only that the clinical mimesis, while not exact, is indeed conspicuous—about as grotesque and conspicuous as its “literary” resemblance to Gogol’s poem.  Beyond that I must conserve my silence. However, I do so only partly to protect the classified information that still surrounds the affair.  There is a better reason, and the sharpest among you in Level 5, after some reflection, will understand what is meant by the silence.

Chichikov knew that …aple, oak, and birch leaves fell uniformly to a crimson and golden carpet that covered the forest floor; and Chichikov beheld the swirling lattices of crisscrossing trajectories of autumn leaves with flat affect. The room that enclosed him was featureless and remained unfamiliar to him, but threatened to become familiar each time he allowed his gaze to rest in any single place for more than a few seconds. This was the solace he found in the staid business of falling autumn leaves crisscrossing at scalene angles, ordered but unrepeating, an argument against (re-)collections of components equipped with properties of coherence and consecutiveness, and hence against remembrance, which he knew was a subset of these, by which the passage of time itself was disabled, and with it the forces of remembrance disarmed. The point of his every gesture, physical or mental, was to resist the tide of cognition welling up within—the recognition of suppressed contents, the connecting of dots, the identification of patterns, correlations, textures, tessellations, the gathering of random shards of quicksilver into coherent mirrors—in a phrase: the firing of neurons. His error all along had been of finding a way to disable the decipher-drive of consciousness, when all that was needed was to disable time.  He had found this window, at least, of falling leaves, by which he could turn off time for himself.  But he knew the tide of cognition arose from without too. Somebody would call at the door, usher him to his appointments and evaluations with Dr. Hank. He allowed himself to fantasize that he would just invite whoever came for him to look out the window, and watch their intentions and any recollection of who they were and what they had been sent to accomplish come unframed, just as his own notions of himself and of “what happened” had come unframed, and then wait for the next person to come for the one who had been sent and entrance them too, and so on with the next one and the next, until time had stopped for the entire world. By modern standards, this was not in fact an outrageous idea, and may have worked had it not been for his own diffidence in the plan.
	Chichikov knew that there was a difference between depictions of things and the things themselves that were depicted. He knew that no matter the intensity with which one gazed at the page of text describing some real or imagined occurrence, the assembly of ink symbols and intervening blank paper fibers on the page would never be the same as the meaning that the ink symbols and intervening blank paper fibers had been arranged to convey. You could watch a leaf fall to the ground, for example, and then draw a picture of your recollection of the event, but you could not then watch the drawn leaf fall to the ground, no matter how intently you gazed at it. Skillful artists could convey the sense of abstract or immaterial natural phenomena, such as an autumn breeze, that then invoked in the subconsciousness of the viewer a sense of before and after, and thus a dynamic illusion of one moment following consecutively after another, even when it was plain to see that all there was was ink and paper. One allowed oneself to be drawn in and immersed in the illusion Skillful observers of skillful artwork should then have no trouble, reasoned Chichikov, reverse engineering the process, by which the skillfully conveyed but false impression of movement and time passing could be neutralized, revealing the true nature of ink and paper beneath the scene. Chichikov knew that “skillful artwork” was, in the limit, Creation itself; and that it must follow that the “skillful artist”, in the limit, was the Creator, Christ Pantocrator, seated at the top of the sky, or rather at the top of the skies so skillfully depicted at the tops of Byzantine cathedral domes. It only remained, then, to take the limit of the “skillful observer of skillful artwork”, and one would arrive at the observer capable of recognizing the unmoving, timeless medium beneath the Illusion of Artful Movement…the poignant
Say you were standing before a painting of some autumn scene in some illustrious museum where such works are kept, for example, thought Chichikov, going over in his mind how he would convince whoever came for him to look out his window and understand that the autumn leaves were not in fact falling from their branches, that, in fact, nothing at all was happening; that is to say, that time had stopped. The abstract feeling of an autumn breeze is skillfully conveyed in this painting you are hypothetically looking at in the museum, he went on to himself, by which you get a sense of autumn leaves shaking loose from their boughs and sailing to the ground. And yet nowhere you looked, in any direction, are there in fact any real leaves falling to the ground. You feel no breeze, hear no rustling of leaves. In fact, it is plainly evident that there is is paint and the canvas on which the scene is painted. But you have a good look, and are drawn in by the mimesis. Who is to say you yourself are not some concoction of fabrics and pigments? You looked up again at the leaves fluttering on their branches, and struggled to see one come loose and sail to the ground on the light autumn breeze, but again and again they just remained there, fluttering on their branches; and then when he looked and saw that a leaf had come loose and was sailing to the ground, it had already come loose from its branch before his gaze alighted upon it. You could tell by the way that the branches were that a tree was present.  You could tell by the way the leaves curled over on themselves that a breeze was present; and yet none of the leaves finished sailing to the ground. Was it that none of it at all was there?  If you could just remain unaware of what it all was, then things continued on normally, but as soon as you tried to know what it was, and to see the leaf, the leaves froze where they were, and did not finish their descent; and the mist further on, and the layers of magenta light weighed on the landscape like heavy sacks.  The world became dead, hard, difficult to figure out. The moment froze and did not carry on to the next moment. But you are philosophically inclined, you know what terms like “prima facie” mean and “want to get at the essence” of everything. You reach out to touch the breeze, setting off alarms in the museum. You feel that it is dry and brittle and threatens to come apart in your hands, because it is, in fact, the mere fabric on which the scene was painted. And, in that last moment before being apprehended by museum gendarmes, you might even hear something that sounds like the whisper of breeze through autumn boughs, but it is only the whisper of old canvas between your fingertips. And yet when you had a good look, you could not deny the landscapes of copse and mansions on hills in the distance, with some goats further on, randomly congregated groups of hounds sitting in the rain, baying their little hearts out for no discernible reason. Or rather, what you could not deny was your appetite to see and be deceived into seeing these things.
[Like this, Chichikov went over what he would say to whoever came for him.] Again and again, we allowed ourselves to fall for reality’s artful depictions, and the brittle parchment of space and time disintegrated between our fingertips. Again and again, reality failed to be real. A little further on there was another valley hidden beneath a thick mist.  Like this you inferred the presence; there was no way of telling it was there, but it was because of this that you could infer its presence.  It was completely evident that what you had were maple trees, gingko trees, plum trees, and willow trees.  If you just had a look and saw the old crooked branches, and the knotted shales of bark, you knew immediately without a doubt what it was, and you could go back to it again and again and know the reality.  But here was the problem; as soon as you went back and knew what the reality was, the leaves froze where they were and did not sail the rest of the way to the ground.  The trees were still.  There was no whisper through any of the branches of any breeze.  The vermillion layers in the distance staled and weighed on the horizon. You could infer, derive, deduce, draw conclusions about the reality of what was taking place before your eyes, in the same way that you inferred the presence of the breeze, coming closer and closer to the conclusion that none of it was there, that it had never been there.  It was there, certainly, causing you the problem, but it was an absence, a negativity.  Absence, negativity, and emptiness were all there too, Chichikov knew.  Perhaps they were the only things that were truly present.  This was the sort of conclusion your laws and formulations were always headed towards, and then you came up with some new laws to try to avoid that destination.
You could not say, as the museum gendarmes dragged you off, that the leaves had continued to fall to the ground all this time, implying a point in the past, before the leaves had continued, and a point in the future after the point of continuation. You could not say that there was an autumn breeze or that there was a forest outside your window. All there was was parchment, ink, chemical pigments. Likewise, Chichikov knew, you could not say that you were in a museum viewing a painting of an autumn scene or that gendarmes were dragging you off, because these were themselves just words written on a different kind of parchment, no less brittle, emitting a susurrus as the fondling of cognition.. But you had to concentrate hard, for at the same time none of these things were really there. All there was was ink formed into different symbols on paper, ostensibly random, by turns, ostensibly ordered according to hidden, phased lattices of ciphers, by turns, phased arrays of strategic target umbrellas.

On the one hand there is an imperative to answer the question “what happened to me?”  On the other hand, there is an imperative to self-preservation, to protect the general syntactical operating coherence on which the mind is premised.
Because the contents cannot be countenanced within the general system of conscious activity, Traumatic contents can bear such an intense emotional charge that their presence in the general system of conscious activity impairs the lower functionality.  Because they cannot be countenanced, the mind, in what is essentially an act of self-defense, will take measures to mask their significance.  The question of “what happened” cannot be answered, because the answer would destroy the general syntactical coherence.  The act of recognizing the contents for what they are, of comprehending the narrative of events which have placed you in your current state of cognitive disorder, would undermine the lower functionality.  And so what happens Chichikov is that the mind, in what is essentially an act of self-defense, takes whatever measures are at its disposal to render the traumatic contents unrecogniziable.
The question of why the mind doesn’t simply shut down and die under such pressures remains a hotly debated mystery. But most researchers agree that the mind is an entropy reducing machine. It is teleologically driven to organize and make sense of the world, to order disordered contents. …
Direct recognition of the traumatic contents would destroy the mind, and yet these contents cannot be erased from the mind, and so the mind is faced with two paradoxical imperatives. It must reduce entropy and yet also expel the pathogen. But the contents cannot be expelled like some pathogen, it is not composed of cells but of illusions built upon other illusions. what happens is that the mind forges self-preserving subconscious mechanisms to suspend the contents from the general system of conscious activity. What ensues is a sort of masque whereby the subconscious mechanisms continuously demolish and recombine the traumatic contents into forms which partly reveal but partly distort or submerge the reality.  of cognitive frames, memory shards, half submerged faces. What ensues [reflective symmetry later on: The dead did not, merely by virtue of their being dead, vanish.  And what the military hardware did was suspend the living into an abstract, nebulous realm, a sort of masque of cognitive frames that sliced up the living into small pieces that were then scattered across the subconscious regions of the sierra…]  And what happens in cases such as yours, Chichikov, is that the mind permutes   but rather must render them as unrecognizable as possible.  The mind will subconsciously churn through the different possible permutations of arrangements of sharded memories. On the one hand, the mind must reject this task, in the interest of its own self-preservation; while on the other hand, the mind is teleologically driven to resolve the question, and gradually draws more and more of the brain’s cognitive resources into the melee.  And what happens, Chichikov, is that the mind will superimpose onto the immediately surrounding environment of sensuously manifest, cognitive surface features, these cycles of permutations, almost as a game.  And each of the permutations is vaguely accurate, but fails to hit the mark.  Giving you a distorted version.
The message is buried in the syntax.  The message is syntax.  It is not that the message is replaced by the cognitive delivery structure.  Rather what I mean to say is that the message becomes so enveloped in the syntactical self-similarity that any distinction between the message and the carrier structure becomes meaningless.
Content is itself a formal way of rendering unfamiliar forms, of parsing through symbols and archetypes which seem to resonate. You’ll never get down to a final layer which can be identified as the source, the bedrock of meaning.  Alan Turing proved this.
And what you’ll find, Chichikov,  is that your mind will parse through the different possible permutations of arrangements of shards, but without ever getting down to a final layer of meaning which you can call real or authentic.  Children are taught in school that the content of a cyphertext is the message.  But you have figured out by now that a message is its own cyphertext—another syntactical structure called English or Russian or Farsi meant to be parsed by consciousness.  There is no reason, then, to call the message deciphered by consciousness the final meaning or the core meaning hidden within the cypher.  What you might call the “core meaning,” then, is itself another syntactical structure, a cognitive delivery system.  Ciphers do not encode messages; they encode other cyphers.  Languages do not convey meaning, but rather other languages.  Languages are not surface realizations of “deep structure,” but of other languages. It is completely arbitrary what level of encryption you choose to call the “message” hidden within the cipher. If there is something at all meaningful about a language, it is its fractal dimension—the measure of how much a language fails to fill the cognitive space. This is what Godel realized in his unpublished notebooks.
The suppressed contents, merely by their being suppressed, do not disappear.
And what happens, Chichikov, is that the mind will suspend the traumatic contents, but the traumatic contents, merely by their being repressed, do not go away.  Because they are unbearable to behold, the mind subconsciously disconfigures them into an unrecognizable form.  The picture of “what happened” is shattered into fragments which are then scattered throughout the subconscious regions of the brain.  However, the information is not thereby deleted, and can be reconstituted from the shards.  The mind continues to try to piece the puzzle together.
The mind will superimpose the suppressed contents onto the surrounding environment.
[reflective symmetery with the dead:]
Chichikov knew that the dead, merely by their being dead, did not vanish altogether.  The dead left a mark—the little divot of air marking their having once been alive—and that this was very different from people who didn’t exist.
Chichikov knew that the dead, merely by their being dead, did not vanish altogether.  The dead left a sort of divot in the aether no longer occupied by their souls—the mark of their having once been alive. This was very different from people who didn’t exist.  This was the much overlooked but critical difference between death and non-existence.  People who were dead had the property of having once been alive.  It was thus possible for other people who were still in the state of being of alive to know of their having existed, and to know of how they passed from the state of being alive to the state of being dead.  The very state of being alive called into existence the binary state space of alive/dead. … However, the hardware could only suspend the living from their lives, at which point they became dead; the hardware could shatter the living into a thousand pieces, and then scatter these pieces across the mountains, forests, rivers, and oceans, but it could not erase the fact that the scattered remains had once composed living bodies.

Chichikov toggled the, putting himself squarely within Hank’s bandwidth.
Hank: But you’re making excellent progress, Chichikov!, and I want you to be proud of that.  Now you’re still struggling, I know, to frame things in their proper context; and it’s tough—ward psychiatrists call this phase the most difficult phase of convalescence.  I’ve decided to reactivate visiting rights on your file again, and to start up your class section again.  But you’re doing an excellent job, Chichikov, making terrific progress, and I think it will be time to start up your class section again.
And then they had a little laugh over the joke.
Chichikov: Where are we?
	Hank: At a restaurant on the waterfront, in Georgetown.
Chichikov: And the names?

Andrei looked up at the sky from under his brow, letting his labor wane a little, and giving his eyes to peek out a little from under the shadow of his brow-line; he felt his eyes emerging from the shadow into the light a little.  He thought, “No, a peacock could not elbow past this banner.”  The contour of his skull where it formed around his eyes lent a darkness to the overall impression of his countenance which people Andrei met in general never put their finger on.  Now, like the thin stem of a flower which rises from the bulb in the soil, Andrei tilted his face at the sky, like the saints in the paintings, when the white dove descends into Mary’s womb, and the saints are gathered around, their heads tilted a little at what is going on in the sky, what is the commotion with the goldenrod in the sky and the dove.  He heard the ch’ih-chaung of the cash register and saw the thin stem of the flower rising heavenward.  Just as the stem which sprouts forth from the bulb beneath the soil, and not some sum or calculation as if made by machine.  Just so, Andrei felt his vision rising to Heaven.
	Then how was it his vision rose to Heaven?  If nothing but what did not evaporate in the face of reason held primacy then what was his vision doing, rising up to Heaven?  He tilted his face at the sky in a pious air, trying to look up after his vision.  Where it was floating off to, and the commotion it made in the sky.  Was it only that he was looking up?  No, he saw his vision clearly floating up through the sky like a rose stem which climbs up from the bulb, sprouting first leaves.  He knew his eyeballs were the bulbs of his vision.  When his vision had sprouted a little ways up, then little leaves would spread, which were like wings which climbed the air.  Leaves, and any sort of life, really, were just the wings which pulled through the ether.  What body the wings belonged to, i.e. life proper which finds itself dragged through the ether, was by turns life’s great question and life’s great answer.  As for what was the “ether” or what kind of feathers and such, these were just words.
	His vision pulled through, infinitely incalculable.  The cash register gave a little ch’au-chang, and what rose Heavenward, what sum, or price, but the stem of a flower!		Andrei knew what he was thinking about now.  He was remembering how he heard all of the Pianos begin to play as he walked down the street to his mother’s house.  Not to say he was not remembering his past too.  But this other remembrance—the remembrance of the Pianos—turned out to have worn his past as a masque just then; thereby to communicate itself to him.  As a rule Andrei never pretended.  His recounting his past was just the secret language by which the minuter remembrance of the Pianos could communicate itself to him just then.  He tried to picture his thoughts in his head to figure out how they pulled off such stunts as this one.  The trunk of a tree began taking shape before him (in his mind).  One half was pink, demarcating one thought, and one half was blue, demarcating the other thought.  No, that model would not do.  His thoughts of his past and his remembrance of the Pianos were of different woods, perhaps of different elements.  The former encompassed all Andrei’s life.  The latter only a half-hour or so.  The latter was only a remembrance, while the former was his past.  Yet this mere remembrance had suffused all his past, used all of its moments to communicate itself!  Had it been so grandiose, the sight of all the Pianos?  Andrei tried hard to remember now:  He had been walking through the capital, peeking over the window sills at all the Pianos in the houses where probably the aristocrats lived.  Then he had heard it.  The Pianos had begun their playing all at once.  He had begun his jumping again, his peeking over the window sills to see what the people looked like playing the pianos but no one was seated at any of the Pianos.  The Pianos were playing by themselves.
It did not make sense that the piano played all by itself with no one at the keys and without it being a player piano—but that was the point of it.  And then it doubly did not make sense that the point of it was that it was a piano that played by itself without any special mechanical device or without a ghost that actually played the piano.  “This is Pianism,” thought Andrei, “this is my movement.—And I am its first martyr!”
He knew that it did not make sense—there were better metaphors to be sure, Kafka’s Castle, Beckett’s Mallone (I’ll go on.  I won’t go on), the Thirty-sixth case of the Mumonkan, for example (A Man of Tao along the Way)—all of the great thinkers who had come before him had already captured it and expressed it in the best way possible, he knew, and that they would say that it did not make sense that the point behind the Piano was that it played by itself—and not because of the aid of some special mechanical device or not because a ghost was playing the piano—the piano was a normal piano, but it played without anyone touching the keys.  Nor was there a ghost present.
“Why did it play all by itself?” they would belabor him with their interrogations, “Very well, you say there’s no mechanism behind it, nothing to be grasped and put into discourse.  But what benefit is to be gained?”
“The benefit, dear sir,” said Andrei on that occasion, “is your very consternation and questioning—that is the whole point!”
	“Ah!”

Huddled ever closer to the ivory slats of the piano—the sign of the cross—dropping them, picking them up again—knowing what he had to do with them, after the most blackguardly manner—labor and capital—quasi-born thing—work is love—knew the games—sensuously manifested putrefaction—the smile as broad as the horizon—the sickening din of steel-coated lathis against unprotected skulls.  There would not be a book that would not be a manifesto.  There would not be a word that would not be a doctrine.  It was not possible to say a word that was not a manifesto.  Not that he had decided it.  You were born into a world, did certain things, were of a certain ilk, thought Andrei.  Well, the world registered it in certain ways, was all he could see.  You did not decide to be of one ilk or another.  You were just a certain way that you had not done, and then the people said “you were that way,” even though it had not been so.  Then this fact, of which no one was guilty, made a certain mark upon the world.  Later on you had the illusion of having done something.
	They were at dinner.  One of the gentlemen seated at the table was asking him why one of the chapters bore a title.  It did not make sense.  All of the other chapters were numbered, then came chapter two which was called A First Martyr of the Pianist Movement.  Why?  Were you about pianos or orchestras?  Did he want to be a writer when he grew up?  He huddled close to the ivory slats.  He had to fasten the ivory slats to the keys of the piano.  His hands trembled; the slats fell from his hand and he had to pick them up again.
	And now they charged him with aloofness, pomposity, condescension.  Yes, they, the dinner guests, the inventors of the loamy depth.  “All in all,” they said, and: “when it comes right down to it.”
You got to the point where you could no longer be alive unless you were dead.  how it was serious at first but then turned out not to be serious.  The one of how it would seem to be a serious thing at first but then turned out to be a joke, the true genius of it.  You could be serious if you were Samuel Beckett, for example, or Maya Angelou.  But then after that it was not possible to be serious.  Andrei had been born after the end of seriousness.  And now you could no longer be serious if it did not turn out later that you had only been joking when it seemed that you were serious.  There were the different ways to say it, the different funny things.  The only one way to see it the life of blustery.  A long, overwrought structure.  The different ways to mean it.  Some of them meant it in a way you didn’t catch at first.  Then some of them meant it in a different way and they got rich.  You were by turns obscure, by turns rich.  O great wisdom!  By turns died obscure and poor, by turns were rich and acclaimed, and O great wisdom of the literary movement great idol.  You alternately rotted away unfit for life and were not even discovered by posterity, alternately held the token of power and fame and were thus ignorant and conceited and were despised when the light of posterity shone on your ignorance and conceit; and thus unfit for life.  You had this way, O great scholarly wisdom,” thought Andrei, in praise of “meeting yourself around back.  Of the extremes meeting and becoming one great universal cycle.  There was that one problem of the conceit of youth, that problem of being able to say such awful, tasteless things without even knowing it.  The long, overwrought artifice stretched out before you, an unworkable quay used by ancestors; it made you vulnerable to the great error of not writing a good novel.  Of finding no way to give an aesthetic sense to your life.  You could end up saying for example, “We are like Dido and Aeneas.”  You could make that error, and then no one would like you.
You looked back even now in the baleful youth of twenty years, even now looked back with wat’ry-eyed hindsight of forty years, to condemn, with even-eyed sobriety pouring out upon the page, the jerky phrase:

No, I cannot countenance it.

Uncommunicative, they had said.  But he had wanted nothing more than to communicate his fellow man.  But there could be no greater disservice to a man than to talk to him in his own language.  For that was patronage.  ‘Twas condescension and aloofness.  No!  Down with windy bourgeois sentiment!  Down with Chummy meta-language!  The aim of literature was to forge a public of actual dignity.  Of the old kind we have had enough—more than enough!  Will you preach to the old kind of public—the stranglers and emasculators of the present age?  All they are interested in is hearing tales about how their outrageous crimes are just.  Should you whisper something else, should you not help them along to the precipice—toward which they are limping with all their might!—they will insult you, viz. they will call you pompous and condescending, insensitive, aloof.  No, with them there is nothing more to talk about.  The whole point of the new literature is that it does not waste its time there, must direct its voice to the new man and the new woman, must be a salutation to the new public, those who will defend the future from the stranglers of the present age—to real dignity, conscious of itself, and not the mimetic, old semblances.
Communicate with a man, thought Andrei, clutching the ivory slats to his chest, dropping them, picking them up again, cutting himself against the flat edges, reach out to a man, win a man’s trust—only to help him along to the edge of the precipice toward which he already mightily limps!, only to insert him further into his shit-world of conceit and self-deception, to assuage his fears that he will go to hell, that his crimes are forgiveable (and thereby sell a book)—no!  That could not be communication.  And—would it not be better to break the legs of such a public, so they will limp no more?
They were asking him what he meant at the dinner table.  Fate: even if you were to The crux of it lay in this: Fate.  Even if you were to leave off in the middle somewhere the notes would still conduce one to the end; so that if one were to do it correctly it would lead to that inevitable end.  Once the basso continuo began playing the descent into the grave it would not stop; it would repeat all the times necessary (37) until Dido’s steps took her into the grave.  If one were to decide to do it correctly.  So that even in the event that the orchestra should stop playing—and why should it?  Life does not stop playing without the orchestra—and one were to say, “No, I shall leave off here.  I do not like where this is headed.”  And you set off down your path of private inquiry, dedicating whole sections of your life to research and introspection; even then the notes upon the page would not be altered and would still lead to the end, so that all your years of learning and introspection could not but lead you, by the very fruit of your learning and introspection, right back to the moment of rejection of the truth at the core of existence: the piano notes lead to the end.  And not in a different way but in just the way,
The astutest at the dinner table made the following remark: “There is a certain grotesquerie, a motif pathetique or enfant that you are belaboring and trying to make new.  But there is not the triumph of Joyce’s Daedalus.”
That kind of triumph is only a provisional triumph.  It was a noble attempt and Andrei smiled.  It was different from what others said.  But you were not able to define it no matter what you said.  Even had you said the most outrageous things it would still not be defined.  “That is what the world does not, and may never, understand about the Pianist Movement,” thought Andrei later on when he went over it in his mind.  Take any work of art and its corresponding body of scholarship.  Take a literary work, for example, or a painting: The objective of scholarship has been to induct the artwork or art-emotion into the framework of familiar thought.  But scholarship, thought Andrei, if it is to exist, must be oriented in the opposite direction.
“No!  If it is really to be of any use to humanity, then scholarship must push the art-object out further into ever more unfamiliar regions of consciousness, so that we are drawn out further with it.  Improved access to the artwork—or, more properly, to the truth it points to—is a good thing; but we must not deign to bring it closer to us, but rather be made to go out to it.  Any work of art that we can hold in the palm of our hand has failed as an artwork.  This was what I had understood by a ‘literary movement,’” Andrei had told the dinner guests seated at the table with him that night.  “The problem with that, you will object,” Andrei had said, “is that the Pianist Movement is of no use to those who are left behind.  Those who are drawn out to the artwork will presumably encounter a new reality which they will be unable to transmit to those of us who have stayed behind.
“In which group would you rather be?” asked Andrei then rhetorically.  Fine then, he had made his point.  There was neither coherence nor incoherence nor both coherence and incoherence nor neither coherence nor incoherence.  All levels of understanding were levels of delusion.  Both delusion and understanding were approximations of the truth and as such at least one step away from it.  It was important to be in the group that went out and perished and did not come back, Andrei knew, because that was the group that had reached the truth, just as the moth had reached the flame.
For that reason they fell silent, found no use for theories and could no longer distinguish between a good carreer move and a bad one.  Andrei himself, Andrei knew, was on the verge of being drawn “too far out” and immolating himself in the moth flame, hence the dilated parameters.  The parameters were:  the fate was: he dreamt once:
After the point of not coming back there would be nothing, not even a blank page.  However, he had still not been consumed in his sorrows and travails, and that was why you still caught glimpses of what it was.  You caught certain dilated or distorted glimpses but it was not true.



Now their number was called and the two gentlemen stood up from their umbrella table and ambled across the creaking pier boards in the direction of the waiter’s signal frequency.  Here you are, said the grinning black-vested waiter, opening his palm voraciously in the direction they must follow.  Chichikov was stricken and they continued on into the elevator, Hank and Chichikov, and descended beneath the pier they sank cozily into shiny next-form suits which were already half-submerged in the bay.  They closed their face shields and sank cozily beneath the water.  Chichikov could hear the oxygen vents beginning to whir behind his neck.  Lofty Cha’an strain-tones drew them deeper towards the dining room.  The other diners began to come into view.  Intermittent forms of grey and white and green sprawling pitifully in the murk of algae.  Chichikov and Hank rotated 45º sweep along their vertical axes, bringing their oblique stomachs to rest against the slanted bank of algae.  Jets of ozone shot from their fontanels, indicating the successful engagement of the dining apparatuses.
Chichikov said: What I would like, Hank, are the names of those who are still alive, but who have died with respect to legal form.  Your dead souls.
Hank: What happens, Chichikov, is that the mind creates a masque or dementia to cover over the suppressed contents, distorting them, and distorting everything that surrounds them, everything that bears the slightest connection to them.  Distorting reality.  The mind not only projects a fictitious event in place of the actual experiences sustained, but projects the whole fictitious background to that fictitious event.  The psychosis projects not only the distorted object, but the distorted world in which it takes place.  The object and field of objectification are the same.  What is called the truth is the composite of these two. / The mind projects a fictitious artifice onto the reality of the experiences sustained—the object of trauma—but it also projects the whole background, the whole field in which it is objectified.  It is the nature of the mind to objectify not only the object, but objectification and the field of objectification.  In the falsification, the making a fiction out of, the object, the field of objectification is also rendered a distorted reflection of itself, and objectification itself is also falsified and made a fiction of: that is, the mode of cognition which produces this falsification is rendered identical to that of the novel.  By projecting the distorted object, the psychosis projects the distorted world.  The obfuscation of the truth content is the projection of the obfuscated truth content and the obfuscated universe of cognition, and hence obfuscated obfuscation, and the distorted distortion.  The whole mind organizes itself around the suppression of the truth content, becoming a function of the suppression, which becomes the central formative activity of consciousness.  But what happens is that when the suppressed content of the past bears an especially powerful psychical charge, the effort required to continue suppression is unsustainable; it threatens to annihilate the whole mind—But this is the problem which we began with: nothing can be annihilated.  It is the illusory aim of suppression to annihilate the suppressed contents.  But it is an illusory aim.  It is impossible to annihilate anything.  What happens is that eventually the suppressed truth content emerges again.  The masque of dementia begins to disintegrate in places, and the truth of the past emerges through the disintegration.

Whether acting alone or in concert with other forces, the Army was found responsible for 85% of all human rights violations and violence registered by the committee.  And the “Civil Defense Patrols,” created by the Army, were found guilty of the remaining 18%.

Hank: All this can be verified, Chichikov, by cross-checking our names against the names of those who were entered into the register
86. Through massacres and scorched earth operations planned by the State, the Army completely exterminated entire civilian communities, destroying households, earnings, crops and other means of bare survival.  626 such massacres were registered… 
Now their number was called and the two gentlemen stood up from their umbrella table and ambled across the creaking pier boards in the direction of the waiter’s signal frequency.  Here you are, said the grinning black-vested waiter, opening his palm voraciously in the direction they must follow.  Chichikov was stricken and they continued on into the elevator, Hank and Chichikov, and descended beneath the pier they sank cozily into shiny next-form suits which were already half-submerged in the bay.  They closed their face shields and sank cozily beneath the water.  Chichikov could hear the oxygen vents beginning to whir behind his neck.  Lofty Cha’an strain-tones drew them deeper towards the dining room.  The other diners began to come into view.  Intermittent forms of grey and white and green sprawling pitifully in the murk of algae.  Chichikov and Hank rotated 45º sweep along their vertical axes, bringing their oblique stomachs to rest against the slanted bank of algae.  Jets of ozone shot from their fontanels, indicating the successful engagement of the dining apparatuses.
Hank asked once more for the names of the dead.
Hank: What happens, Chichikov, is that the mind creates a masque or dementia to cover over the suppressed contents, distorting them, and distorting everything that surrounds them, everything that bears the slightest connection to them.  Distorting reality.  The mind not only projects a fictitious event in place of the actual experiences sustained, but projects the whole fictitious background to that fictitious event.  The psychosis projects not only the distorted object, but the distorted world in which it takes place.  The object and field of objectification are the same.  What is called the truth is the composite of these two. / The mind projects a fictitious artifice onto the reality of the experiences sustained—the object of trauma—but it also projects the whole background, the whole field in which it is objectified.  It is the nature of the mind to objectify not only the object, but objectification and the field of objectification.  In the falsification, the making a fiction out of, the object, the field of objectification is also rendered a distorted reflection of itself, and objectification itself is also falsified and made a fiction of: that is, the mode of cognition which produces this falsification is rendered identical to that of the novel.  By projecting the distorted object, the psychosis projects the distorted world.  The obfuscation of the truth content is the projection of the obfuscated truth content and the obfuscated universe of cognition, and hence obfuscated obfuscation, and the distorted distortion.  The whole mind organizes itself around the suppression of the truth content, becoming a function of the suppression, which becomes the central formative activity of consciousness.  But what happens is that when the suppressed content of the past bears an especially powerful psychical charge, the effort required to continue suppression is unsustainable; it threatens to annihilate the whole mind—But this is the problem which we began with: nothing can be annihilated.  It is the illusory aim of suppression to annihilate the suppressed contents.  But it is an illusory aim.  It is impossible to annihilate anything.  What happens is that eventually the suppressed truth content emerges again.  The masque of dementia begins to disintegrate in places, and the truth of the past emerges through the disintegration.
The ghosts of the past were harmless digressions; and since the past in which they took place no longer existed, they themselves can no longer be said to have taken place.  Chichikov knew for example that the dead could not suddenly burst out of the earth and come get you, and drag your soul down to hell.  They were not there waiting to reach out their flayed arms and pull up your soul like a little turnip.  Like this, Chichikov’s thoughts went out and peopled the confines of his gaze.  Objects, too, seemed to mingle.  The only problem was whether you were really yourself, or whether you had become the ghost of yourself and were one of the ones who deserved to be dragged down to hell.
After this, the mansion appeared atop a knob in the distance, and gradually came into view.  Three English gardens were planted on the slope, beside which sat a squat gazebo of some brownish color, enclosed, in its turn, within a pentagonal arrangement of lattice gates—a structure, perhaps, with pretensions to being an arboretum of some sort, over which was hung a wooden sign that read: “The Pentagon of Solitary Contemplation.”


Chichikov gave a little laugh and continued striding down the turbulent grain heath, knowing too well the pageantry of meaning and agreeable gentlemen.  Still, it was just the sort of remark that he found paltry, facile—unworthy, at any rate, of the repertoire of agreeable gentlemen.  He could not help that his bile was turned, and he turned and spat briefly, sideways into the wind; and some of the frown that was in his heart found its way up into the corners of his lips, which began twitching sporadically, with the result that there once again appeared on our hero’s face a look of spectacular meaningness, such as can only be seen at Petersburg dinner parties—it appears to be some sort of roguish bemusement at first, but in the next moment God alone can say: it’s not neurasthenia; it’s not epilepsy, nor even some demonstration of magnetic properties—devil knows what it is!  He turned aside and vomited briefly into the heath.



Hank: Ted and Linda are here to take you out to lunch, Chichikov, isn’t that swell?
What happened was, Bruce Willis was running down the street shooting, and…what happens Chichikov, is that Meg Ryan …
The little data shitstorm of chummy, bourgeois colloquialisms, chock-a-block with pop refs.

Welcome to

THE VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL MEMORIAL

FACTS FOR THE VISITOR

e567/56:// Welcome to the Vietnam War Memorial Memorial (originally located beside the Lincoln Memorial).  In the old days, war was thought of more in the narrow sense of “armed conflict,” rather than of market-correcting phenomena, and you will notice that the structure here preserved (originally built in 1982) differs from the other War Memorials on the Mall accordingly—most striking perhaps is its absolute lack of any data tickers or digital streaming devices/LCDs.  Originally constructed in 1982, the vexing swoop of black marble and the engraved list of fatalities apparently referred only to a specific period of the Vietnam conflict and not to the ongoing, permanent equilibria-event.  The vexing swoop of black marble and the rather unwieldy engraved list of fatalities apparently referred only to a specific period of the Vietnam conflict (most likely the original period, 1965-1973).  Astonishing as it may be to today’s visitors, the original function of this monument appears to have been nothing more than to remind people that the “conflict” had “happened.”  The data which you see chiseled out on the low monolith face, for example, is completely unautomated, and is not linked to the Stock Exchange in any way.

Chichikov regarded the names engraved in the marble slabs one last time:

[blacked out]fdvdfv

It is interesting because you don’t know in the end if it is really happening or just another projection of the dementia; or whether the events of the past really happened or were just adornments superimposed by the psychosis on top of the truth, which was still too painful to face.  You are never sure whether the reality that is being presented is the reality of what actually happened, or just another projection of the dementia; and what you don’t wonder is whether the present reality is actually a manipulation of what is happening in order to reflect something else which, even though it had happened, remained unarticulated.
